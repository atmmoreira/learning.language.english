# The present simple
> The present simple is used to make simple statements of fact, to talk about things that happen repeatedly, and to describe things that are always true.

<br>

Tips ::
  - To make the present simple of most verbs, use the base form (the infinitive without 'to').

<br>

Examples ::
  - I `eat` lunch at noon every* day. *Adverbs of frequency are often used with the present simple.
  - She `eats*` lunch at 2pm every day. *With 'he, she, and it' we add -s to the base form.

<br>

Examples ::
- We `drink` coffee every morning
- We `start` work at 9am.
- They `leave` work at 5pm.
- `She drinks` coffee every morning.
